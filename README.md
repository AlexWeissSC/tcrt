python3 implementation of the r/roguelikedev tutorial 
https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

Finished the tutorial. 

Added scrolling map with the help of this 
https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/piy5gz/scrolling_map_libtcodpython/ (https://github.com/fzachman/flotsom_rl)

The Tileset consists of a mix of this Dwarf Fortress Font Redjack17.png from Jackard 
http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Tileset_repository#Curses_24pt_cleartype_ThomModifications.PNG
and Kenney's 1-bit-pack https://www.kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack

Doors were added and some experimenting with map creation.
